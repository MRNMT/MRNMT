## Description
This package contains a professional-looking software developer headshot optimized for use as a GitHub avatar (or other social/dev platforms). The images are cropped and sized to make it easy to upload and display crisply across devices.

---

## Recommended sizes & formats
- GitHub recommends a square image. Any square PNG/JPEG works fine.  
- Common sizes to provide good results:
  - **1024Ã—1024** â€” high resolution (useful if you also want to use the image elsewhere)
  - **512Ã—512** â€” ideal for profile avatars
  - **400Ã—400** â€” smaller alias for speed
- Use **PNG** for transparency or slight compression artifacts; **JPEG** if you prefer smaller file sizes with photography.

## How to upload as GitHub avatar
1. Sign in to GitHub and go to your profile (click your avatar â†’ **Your profile**).  
2. Click **Edit profile** (on the right).  
3. Click your current avatar image area (or the camera icon) â†’ **Upload new picture**.  
4. Choose one of the files from this package (e.g., `avatar-512.png`).  
5. Adjust the crop/zoom preview if needed, then click **Set new profile picture**.  
6. Save profile changes.

Tip: Use `avatar-circle.png` only if the site preserves transparency; otherwise use one of the square images.

## Cropping & framing tips
- Keep the subject centered and leave a little headroom (top margin) so circular crops donâ€™t cut off hair.  
- Aim for the face to occupy ~60â€“75% of the frame for best visibility at small sizes.  
- If you crop yourself, export as a square image (1:1 aspect ratio).
